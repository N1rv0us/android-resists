Many thanks to reveny for providing the project as the basis for this study!

Original project : [GitHub - reveny/Android-Library-Remap-Hide: Remap a library to avoid detection](https://github.com/reveny/Android-Library-Remap-Hide)

The core code is referenced from the project above, and a small amount of meaningless code has been added for ease of learning.

Also this concept is inspired by Riru and Zygisk
